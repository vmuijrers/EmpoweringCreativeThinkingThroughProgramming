##This is the last lab!

## Pong
## Basic
Create a class called Paddle, create two paddle objects (one for each player) which can be controlled with WASD and the arrow keys respectively.
Put one paddle at the left side of the screen, and the other paddle at the right side of the screen.
Make sure the paddles can only move up and down and make sure they cannot leave the screen. (Think of which attributes and methods this class needs).  
Put both paddles into one list, do not make separate variables for the paddles.  

## Advanced
Add the ball-class of the previous labs to your project.
Create a new score-class which keeps score for both players.
Make sure that when a ball hits the screenside of a player, the other player scores a point.
Change the size of a ball when it scores a point.  

## Expert
Add one or more of the following:  
- Add collision between balls and paddles and collision between balls and balls.  
- Reset the game when one of the players reaches 5 points
- Add your own gameplay mechanic! Make sure you describe your added mechanic in comments
