##Exercise 1_0 

Download Python 3.6.2: 
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Download Processing 3.3.5:
https://processing.org/download/?processing

Create a new sketch and save it under the name: ECTTP_homework_achternaam_voornaam_labnr

At the right top you will find a dropdown button which says Java, click on it and select Add Mode... type in Python and install the python module (this may require a restart of processing).
You are now ready to program your first code!

##Exercise 1_1 

Create a program which prints "Hello World", use the print function to print 

##Exercise 1_2  

Go to http://py.processing.org/reference/ and look for the function called size()
Adjust the screen size by using the size function 
Then look for the rect() function
Use it to draw a rectangle on your screen

Try storing the numbers you use by making a variable for each number, if you don't know how to create a variable, check the slides or ask the student assistents!

When you are done, zip your entire folder and send it to your lab teacher (see top of the page, DO NOT EMAIL YOUR ASSIGNMENT)

####Are you lost? 
SPEAK UP! We will help you I promise. Don't let this drag on and you are not alone! :) 
Programming is crazy hard the first time you learn about it.
 
Why not give this site a try. It's super awesome and very clear. http://www.learnpython.org 

####Are you bored? 
Are you horridly bored? Check out some of the examples in Processing under File > Examples... 
Pick a category (I recommend Topics/Simulate/Flocking) and try changing some of the values to see what happens
