##Exercise 4_0 

Create a textfield which shows a score as follows "Score: <score>" (You can use the text(StringValue, IntegerXposition, IntegerYposition) for the drawing of text), starting at zero.  
Make it so that when the user clicks the left mouseButton a score of 10 is added to the result.  

##Exercise 4_1	 

Create a rectangle on screen and make it so that when the user clicks inside the rectangle, a score of 20 is added to the score value.  
Set the position (note that a position consists of two values, x and y) of the rectangle to a new random position within the screen after it is clicked.  
Set the size of the rectangle to a random value between 50 and 200 after it is clicked.  

##Exercise 4_2  

Instead of setting the score directly, make it so that the score lerps towards the new value, showing all values in between the
current value and the newValue. (Use max 60 frames for the lerp)  
Instead of setting the new position directly, make it so that the rectangle lerps towards its new position (visually it will slide
towards its new position).(Use max 60 frames for the lerp)  
Instead of setting the new size directly, make it so that the rectangle lerps towards its new size (use max 60 frames for the lerp).  
Make sure the rectangle cannot be clicked while it is moving.
