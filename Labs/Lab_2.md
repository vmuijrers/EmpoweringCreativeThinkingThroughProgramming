*Readability* | The code is exceptionally well organized and very easy to follow. | The code is fairly easy to read. | The code is readable only by someone who knows what it is supposed to be doing.| The code is poorly organized and very difficult to read.|

##Exercise 2_0 

Use the setup() function and the draw() function to draw an orange ellipse to the screen

##Exercise 2_1 

Use a variable for the x-position of the ellipse and inside the draw function add 1 to the variable you just created, every frame so that the ellipse starts moving to the right

##Exercise 2_2  

Make a blue square which moves from the right bottom corner to the left top of the screen   
Try to make it go back and forth so that it never leaves the screen   
(hint: check the reference for the if-statement or take a look at the lerp-function)
