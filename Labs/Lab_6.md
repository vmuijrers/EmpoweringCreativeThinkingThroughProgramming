## Lab 6: 
 

##### Grading Matrix 

Trait | Very Good | Good | Acceptable | Unsatisfactory	
--- |--- | --- | --- | --- |
| *Specifications* | The program produces correct results and meets all specifications. | The program works and produces the correct results and displays them correctly. It also meets most of the other specifications. | The program produces correct results but does not display them correctly. | The program is producing incorrect results.


##Exercise 6_0 

Write a function called wheels(cars, trikes, bikes), which, given how many cars, trikes (threewheeler) and bikes you have, returns how many wheels you have in total.

Example:  
wheels(3,5,2)  -> 31
wheels(5,1,1) -> 25  


##Exercise 6_1	 

Write a function called XOR(a, b), which, given two booleans a and b, returns True if exactly one of the two inputs is True, otherwise return False

Example:  
XOR(True, False) -> True  
XOR(True, True) -> False


##Exercise 6_2  

Write a function called pancakes(eggs, milk, flour) which returns how many pancakes you can make (as an integer) from the given ingredients (eggs denotes how many eggs you have, milk denotes how many ml milk you have, flour how many grams of flower you have).  
You know that you can make 10 pancakes with 2 eggs, 500 ml melk and 250 grams of flour.  
You can only make batches of 10 pancakes at once (so if you only have one egg left, you cannot make any more pancakes).
Print a few results outside your function. Also print how many ingredients you have left.

Example:  
pancakes(6,2000,1000)  -> 30
pancakes(8,1000,1000)  -> 20

Print example (You can put the print statement in your function, but make sure the function returns just the amount of pancakes):
"You can make: 30 pancakes, with 6 eggs, 1500 ml milk and 750 grams of flour. You have 0 eggs, 500 ml milk and 250 grams of flour left."
